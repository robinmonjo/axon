defmodule Axon.Loop do
  @moduledoc """
  Abstraction for modeling a reduction of a dataset with an accumulated
  state for a number of epochs.

  Inspired heavily by [PyTorch Ignite](https://pytorch.org/ignite/index.html).

  The main abstraction is the `%Loop{}` struct, which controls a nested
  reduction of the form:

      Enum.reduce(1..max_epochs, state, fn epoch, state ->
        Enum.reduce(data, state, &batch_step/2)
      end)

  `data` is assumed to be an `Enumerable` or `Stream` of input data which is
  handled by a processing function, `batch_step`. The purpose of the loop
  abstraction is to take away much of the boilerplate used in solving machine
  learning tasks. Tasks such as normalizing a dataset, hyperparameter optimization,
  or training machine learning models boil down to writing one function:

      defn batch_step(batch, state) do
        # ...do something with batch...
        updated_state
      end

  For tasks such as training a neural network, `state` will encapsulate things
  such as model and optimizer state. For supervised learning tasks, `batch_step`
  might look something like:

      defn batch_step({inputs, targets}, state) do
        %{parameters: params, optimizer_state: optim_state} = state

        gradients = grad(params, objective_fn.(&1, inputs, targets))
        {updates, new_optim_state} = optimizer.(optim_state, params, gradients)

        new_params = apply_updates(params, updates)

        %{parameters: new_params, optimizer_state: optim_state}
      end

  `batch_step` takes a batch of `{input, target}` pairs and the current state,
  and updates the model parameters based on the gradients received from some arbitrary
  objective function. This function will run in a nested loop, iterating over the entire
  dataset for `N` epochs before finally returning the trained model state. By defining
  1 function, we've created a training loop that works for most machine learning models.

  In actuality, the loop abstraction accumulates a struct, `Axon.Loop.State`, which looks
  like (assuming `container` is a generic Elixir container of tensors, e.g. map, tuple, etc.):

      %State{
        epoch: tensor(),
        max_epoch: tensor(),
        iteration: tensor(),
        max_iteration: tensor(),
        metrics: map(string(), container()),
        times: list(number()),
        step_state: container()
      }

  `batch_step` takes in the batch and the step state field and returns a `step_state`,
  which is a generic container of state accumulated at each iteration. The rest of the fields
  in the state struct are updated automatically behind the scenes.

  The loop must start from some initial step state, thus most tasks must also provide
  an additional initialization function to provide some starting point for the step
  state. For machine learning tasks, the initialization function will return things like
  initial model parameters and optimizer state.

  Typically, the final output of the loop is the accumulated final state; however, you
  may optionally apply an output transform to extract specific values at the end of the
  loop. For example, `Axon.Loop.trainer/4` by default extracts trained model state:

      output_transform = fn state ->
        state.step_state[:model_state]
      end

  ## Initialize and Step

  The core of the Axon loop are the init and step functions. The initialization is an
  arity-0 function which provides an initial step state:

      init = fn ->
        %{params: Axon.init(model)}
      end

  While the step function is the `batch_step` function mentioned earlier:

      step = fn data, state ->
        new_state = # ...do something...
        new_state
      end

  ## Metrics

  Often times you want to compute metrics assosciated with your training iterations.
  To accomplish this, you can attach metrics to each `Axon.Loop`. Assuming a `batch_step`
  function which looks like:

      defn batch_step({inputs, targets}, state) do
        %{parameters: params, optimizer_state: optim_state} = state

        gradients = grad(params, objective_fn.(&1, inputs, targets))
        {updates, new_optim_state} = optimizer.(optim_state, params, gradients)

        new_params = apply_updates(params, updates)

        # Shown for simplicity, you can optimize this by calculating preds
        # along with the gradient calculation
        preds = model_fn.(params, inputs)

        %{
          y_true: targets,
          y_pred: preds,
          parameters: new_params,
          optimizer_state: optim_state
        }
      end

  You can attach metrics to this by using `Axon.Loop.metric/4`:

      Axon.Loop.loop(&batch_step/2)
      |> Axon.Loop.metric("Accuracy", :accuracy, fn %{y_true: y_, y_pred: y} -> [y_, y] end)
      |> Axon.Loop.run(data)

  Because metrics work directly on `step_state`, you typically need to provide an output
  transform to indicate which values should be passed to your metric function. By default,
  Axon assumes a supervised training task with the fields `:y_true` and `:y_pred` present
  in the step state. See `Axon.Loop.metric/4` for more information.

  Metrics will be tracked in the loop state using the user-provided key. Metrics integrate
  seamlessly with the supervised metrics defined in `Axon.Metrics`. You can also use metrics
  to keep running averages of some values in the original dataset.

  ## Events and Handlers

  You can instrument several points in the loop using event handlers. By default, several events
  are fired when running a loop:

      events = [
        :started,             # After loop state initialization
        :epoch_started,       # On epoch start
        :iteration_started,   # On iteration start
        :iteration_completed, # On iteration complete
        :epoch_completed,     # On epoch complete
        :epoch_halted,        # On epoch halt, if early halted
        :halted,              # On loop halt, if early halted
        :completed            # On loop completion
      ]

  You can attach event handlers to events using `Axon.Loop.handle/4`:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.handle(:iteration_completed, &log_metrics/1, every: 100)
      |> Axon.Loop.run(data)

  The above will trigger `log_metrics/1` every 100 times the `:iteration_completed` event
  is fired. Event handlers must return a tuple `{status, state}`, where `status` is an
  atom with one of the following values:

      :continue   # Continue epoch, continue looping
      :halt_epoch # Halt the epoch, continue looping
      :halt_loop  # Halt looping

  And `state` is an updated `Axon.Loop.State` struct. Handler functions take as input
  the current loop state.

  It's important to note that event handlers are triggered in the order they are attached
  to the loop. If you have two handlers on the same event, they will trigger in order:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.handle(:epoch_completed, &normalize_state/1) # Runs first
      |> Axon.Loop.handle(:epoch_completed, &log_state/1) # Runs second

  You may provide filters to filter when event handlers trigger. See `Axon.Loop.handle/4`
  for more details on valid filters.

  ## Factories

  Axon loops are typically created from one of the factory functions provided in this
  module:

      * `Axon.Loop.loop/3` - Creates a loop from step function and optional initialization
      functions and output transform functions.

      * `Axon.Loop.trainer/3` - Creates a supervised training loop from model, loss, and
      optimizer.

      * `Axon.Loop.evaluator/2` - Creates a supervised evaluator loop from model and model
      state.

  ## Running loops

  In order to execute a loop, you should use `Axon.Loop.run/3`:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.run(data, epochs: 10)

  ## Resuming loops

  At times you may want to resume a loop from some previous state. You can accomplish this
  with `Axon.Loop.from_state/2`:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.from_state(state)
      |> Axon.Loop.run(data)

  Creates a supervised training loop from a model, loss function,

  This function is useful for training models on most standard supervised
  learning tasks. It assumes data consists of tuples of input-target pairs,
  e.g. `[{x0, y0}, {x1, y1}, ..., {xN, yN}]` where `x0` and `y0` are batched
  tensors or containers of batched tensors.

  It defines an initialization function which first initializes model state
  using the given model and then initializes optimizer state using the initial
  model state. The step function uses a differentiable objective function
  defined with respect to the model parameters, input data, and target data
  using the given loss function. It then updates model parameters using the

  An evaluator can be used for things such as testing and validation of models

  @doc """
  Adds a metric of the given name to the loop.

  A metric is a function which tracks or measures some value with respect
  to values in the step state. For example, when training classification
  models, it's common to track the model's accuracy during training:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.metric(:accuracy, "Accuracy")

  By default, metrics assume a supervised learning task and extract the fields
  `[:y_true, :y_pred]` from the step state. If you wish to work on a different
  value, you can use an output transform. An output transform is a list of keys
  to extract from the output state, or a function which returns a flattened list
  of values to pass to the given metric function. Values received from output
  transforms are passed to the given metric using:

      value = output_transform.(step_state)
      apply(metric, value)

  Thus, even if you want your metric to work on a container, your output transform
  must return a list.

  `metric` must be an atom which matches the name of a metric in `Axon.Metrics`, or
  an arbitrary function which returns a tensor or container.

  `name` must be a string or atom used to store the computed metric in the loop
  state. If names conflict, the last attached metric will take precedence:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.metric(:mean_squared_error, "Error") # Will be overwritten
      |> Axon.Loop.metric(:mean_absolute_error, "Error") # Will be used

  By default, metrics keep a running average of the metric calculation. You can
  override this behavior by changing `accumulate`:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.metric(:true_negatives, "tn", :running_sum)

  Accumulation function can be one of the accumulation combinators in Axon.Metrics
  or an arity-3 function of the form: `accumulate(acc, obs, i) :: new_acc`.

  @doc """
  Adds a handler function to the loop which will be triggered on `event`
  with an optional filter.

  Events take place at different points during loop execution. The default
  events are:

      events = [
        :started,             # After loop state initialization
        :epoch_started,       # On epoch start
        :iteration_started,   # On iteration start
        :iteration_completed, # On iteration complete
        :epoch_completed,     # On epoch complete
        :epoch_halted,        # On epoch halt, if early halted
        :halted,              # On loop halt, if early halted
        :completed            # On loop completion
      ]

  Generally, event handlers are side-effecting operations which provide some
  sort of inspection into the loop's progress. It's important to note that
  if you define multiple handlers to be triggered on the same event, they
  will execute in order from when they were attached to the training
  loop:

      loop
      |> Axon.Loop.handle(:epoch_started, &normalize_step_state/1) # executes first
      |> Axon.Loop.handle(:epoch_started, &log_step_state/1) # executes second

  Thus, if you have separate handlers which alter or depend on loop state,
  you need to ensure they are ordered correctly, or combined into a single
  event handler for maximum control over execution.

  `event` must be an atom representing the event to trigger `handler` or a
  list of atoms indicating `handler` should be triggered on multiple events.
  `event` may be `:all` which indicates the handler should be triggered on
  every event during loop processing.

  `handler` must be an arity-1 function which takes as input loop state and
  returns `{status, state}`, where `status` is an atom with one of the following
  values:

  `filter` is an atom representing a valid filter predicate, a keyword of
  predicate-value pairs, or a function which takes loop state and returns
  a `true`, indicating the handler should run, or `false`, indicating the
  handler should not run. Valid predicates are:

      :always # Always trigger event
      :once   # Trigger on first event firing

  Valid predicate-value pairs are:

      every: N # Trigger every `N` event
      only: N # Trigger on `N` event
